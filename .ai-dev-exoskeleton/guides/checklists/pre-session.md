# Pre-Session Checklist

> Human-optional. I don't personally run this every time — once the habit is internalized,
> you just do it. But it's a useful scaffold when you're new to the method or onboarding a
> team, so it's kept here.

Before starting ANY AI coding session, answer these 6 questions:

## 1. What is the ONE outcome?
Write it in one sentence. If you need "and" — split into two sessions.
```
Example BAD:  "Migrate Redis pub/sub to streams AND update all handlers"
Example GOOD: "Create the RedisStreamPublisher adapter"
```

## 2. Which mode?
- [ ] **Plan** — produce a plan document; never touches source code
- [ ] **Implement** — change the codebase (code, tests, config) following a plan
- [ ] **Debug** — find the root cause of a specific bug; fix only after it's confirmed
- [ ] **Review** — analyze a change and report findings; never touches source code
- [ ] **Explore** — read the codebase to answer questions or document it; never touches
      source code

Note: "never touches source code" is the boundary that matters — plan, review, and explore
all *write their own markdown artifacts* (a plan, a review, `docs/context/` docs). What
they don't do is modify the project itself. Onboarding runs in explore mode for exactly
this reason: it reads all the code and writes only documentation.

## 3. What's in scope?
List the directories/files. Everything else is OFF LIMITS.
```
SCOPE: app/services/profile_service.py, app/interfaces/profile/repo.py, tests/test_profile_service.py
```

## 4. What must it NOT do?

The most valuable line in most prompts. A stop condition says when to finish; a constraint
keeps the agent out of the ditch on the way there. Be specific and negative:
```
CONSTRAINT: don't refactor existing code
CONSTRAINT: no code yet — analysis only
CONSTRAINT: don't change the API surface or rename anything
CONSTRAINT: don't add new dependencies
CONSTRAINT: don't touch the migration files
```
If a previous session went wrong in a way you can name, that name is your next constraint.

## 5. What does "done" look like?
```
Example: "Unit test for get_or_create_profile passes"
Example: "Plan document written to docs/tasks/20260304-redis-migration/PLAN.md"
Example: "Root cause identified with evidence, fix not yet applied"
```

## 6. Does this fit in one session?

Don't calibrate on minutes or message counts — those shift with every model generation.
Calibrate on **units of work and the context window you have**:

- **The unit is a phase**: one scope, one verifiable "done" you can state in a single
  sentence without "and."
- **How many phases per session depends on the window.** One on a ~200k window; several on
  a ~1M one. See Law 1.
- **Too big** for any window if: you can't describe "done" without a list, or you find
  yourself planning mid-implementation.
- **Too small** if: it finishes in a couple of exchanges with nothing to verify — fold it
  into the neighbouring piece.

**Then watch context rot as you go.** Quality degrades before the window runs out — around
60–70% utilisation you'll see the agent lose earlier decisions, re-read files it already
read, or drift from constraints stated at the top. That's the real signal to stop, not the
token count. End the session and start fresh from the plan and task folder.

## Quick-Start Templates

### Feature Session (start here)
```
Read @.ai-dev-exoskeleton/commands/build-context.md and follow it.
I want to build [feature description].
```
This begins the feature workflow at context-building; see
`.ai-dev-exoskeleton/guides/workflows/feature.md` for the full session sequence.

### Planning Session
```
I need a plan for [X]. Read @.ai-dev-exoskeleton/agents/planner.md and follow it.
SCOPE: [directories to analyze]
Create a task folder at docs/tasks/[yyyymmdd-name]/ and write the plan to PLAN.md.
Do NOT implement anything.
```

### Implementation Session
```
Implement Phase [N] from docs/tasks/[yyyymmdd-name]/PLAN.md. Read @.ai-dev-exoskeleton/agents/implementer.md and follow it.
Read docs/context/ files if they exist for architecture and pattern context.
SCOPE: [files from the plan]
Write tests first, then implement. Run tests after.
```

### Debug Session
```
Debug this error. Read @.ai-dev-exoskeleton/agents/debugger.md and follow it.
Read docs/context/ files if they exist for architecture and dependency context.
SCOPE: [directory]
ERROR: [paste traceback]
Trace the root cause first. Do NOT change code until I confirm.
```
